      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! You have reached my personal webpage. Thank you for taking the time to land here. By profession, I am a postdoctoral research assocaite at Lehigh University working actively in understanding the glas to crystal transition induced due to laser irradiation. Our research group has a number of graduate students working on the experimental side while I work on the computational modeling in search of the link between what is experimentally observed and what I can predict theoretically through the atomic-scale simulations.   </p>
      <p>As the leader of the simulation efforts, I am responsible for setting up the simulations which requires accessing high performance computing (HPC) resources as the simulations are computationally expensive and requires the use of parallel computing on upto couple hundred cores using MPI/OPENMP parallel computing. <p>
