      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! You have reached my personal webpage. Thank you for taking the time to land here. By profession, I am a postdoctoral research assocaite at Lehigh University working actively in understanding the glas to crystal transition induced due to laser irradiation. Our research group has a number of graduate students working on the experimental side while I work on the computational modeling in search of the link between what is experimentally observed and what I can predict theoretically through the atomic-scale simulations.   </p>
      <p>As the leader and solo contributor to the simulation efforts, I am responsible for setting up the simulations which requires using <b>High Performance Computing (HPC)</b> resources with <b>MPI/OPENMP</b> parallel computing on hundred cores. Setting up the simulation requires a sound knowledge of molecular dynamics coupled with a clear understanding of the source code written in <b>Python</b> programming language. The management of <b> data storage, data pipeline, and data intergrity </b> in order to faciliate productive data analysis and research output is also a part of my job. <p>
      <p>Throughout my PhD and PostDoc career, I have been actively engaged in data analysis of the outputs from various simulation. This often required handling files with millions of rows needing creation of new algorithm, numerical methods, and computer program for systematic and efficient data analysis. Generating research insights from the data often involved relationship searches between various variables of interest using <b>Linear Regression</b>, segregating crystal-like atoms from non-cyrstal like atoms using machine-learned <b>Clustering algorithm</b>.Furthermore, I was actively involved in implementing and updating an in-house simulation code called <b>Force Enhanced Atomic Refinement (FEAR)</b> that combines <b>Markov Chain Monte Carlo</b> techniuqes with force-field driven <b>Conjugate Gradient</b> energy minimization to create realistic models of amorphous materials.</p>
